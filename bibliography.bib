	abstract = {This study treats the feasibility of long-lived hafnium hydride control rod in a large sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor by nuclear and thermal analyses. According to the nuclear calculations, it is found that hydrogen absorption of hafnium triples the reactivity by the neutron spectrum shift at the H/Hf ratio of 1.3, and a hafnium transmutation mechanism that produced daughters are absorbers quadruples the lifetime due to a low incineration rate of absorbing nuclides under irradiation. That is to say, the control rod can function well for a long time because an irradiation of 2400 {EFPD} reduces the reactivity by only 4\%. The calculation also reveals that the hafnium hydride control rod can apply to the reactor in that nuclear and thermal characteristics become as good as or better than 80\% B-10 enriched boron carbide. For example, the maximum linear heat rate becomes 3\% lower. Owing to the better power distribution, the required flow rate decreases approximately by 1\%. Consequently, it is concluded on desk analyses that the long lived hafnium hydride control rod is feasible in the large sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor.},

	abstract = {As new environmentally friendly techniques, hydride materials have been proposed to be introduced to fast reactor ({FR}) cores in this paper. Hydrogen atoms in metal hydride can efficiently moderate fast neutrons. Based on this fact, some metal hydrides have been investigated for their potential environmentally friendly application as nuclear materials to be used in {FR} cores. Two types of utilisation of metal hydrides in {FR} cores are discussed in this paper. One is the application of hafnium hydride as neutron absorber in {FR} cores. The core design has been carried out to examine its characteristics as well as to evaluate the cost reduction effect. Demonstration of the fabrication of hydride pins has been performed using hydride pellets and stainless steel claddings. The coating technique of the inner cladding surface has also been developed to reduce the permeation of hydrogen through the stainless steel cladding. The physical and chemical properties of the pellet have been measured for the purpose of designing a hafnium hydride pin. Irradiation test of the hydride pins has been performed in the experimental {FR}, {JOYO}, Japan Atomic Energy Agency. The other application is the utilisation as a transmutation target of long lived nuclear wastes. Hydride fuel containing 237Np, 241Am and 243Am has been studied for a candidate transmutation target to be used to reduce the radioactivity of long lived nuclides contained in the nuclear wastes, which are obtained after reprocessing spent fuels.},

	abstract = {Fabrication tests of hafnium hydride pellets were performed for several sizes in a diameter range of 5 to 10 mm and a height range of 2 to 10 mm in order to establish the fabrication process for hafnium hydride neutron absorber Hafnium metal pellets were hydrogenated at high temperature while controlling the amount of the supplied hydrogen to get hafnium hydride pellets with several different hydrogen to hafnium ratios. The samples were expanded by hydrogen absorption and slight barrel shape transformations were observed. No cracks, however, were observed in the obtained hafnium hydrides. The dependence of density on the hydrogen to hafnium ratio showed good reproducibility without any effects from the experience of hydrogen desorption and/or re-hydrogenation process. This indicated that the hydrogen content can be adjusted easily in the fabrication process of hydride pellets. Out-of-pile experiments were performed at high temperature using the obtained hafnium hydrides to evaluate the integrity of the control rod with hafnium hydride absorbers during heat cycle tests between 500 to 700 °C and temperature transient tests at 25 to 30 °C/min. After the temperature transient tests and the heat cycle tests, the integrity and the hydrogen to hafnium ratio of hafnium hydrides were evaluated. No cracks were observed in any hafnium specimens after these tests. The amount of hydrogen lost from the hydrides was negligibly small during both heat cycle and temperature transient tests. This indicated that the heat cycle and the temperature transient had negligible effects on the integrity of hafnium hydride.},
