	abstract = {This paper describes considerations for siting and designing a facility for deep borehole disposal of spent
nuclear fuel (SNF) and/or high-level radioactive waste (HLW). Technical considerations include
geological, hydrogeochemical, and geophysical characteristics that are related to the suitability of the site
for deep drilling and borehole construction, waste emplacement activities, waste isolation (seals and
surrounding geology), and long-term safety of the deep borehole disposal system. Logistical factors to be
considered include: local or regional availability of drilling contractors (equipment, services, and
materials) capable of drilling a large-diameter hole to approximately 5,000 m depth; construction of
surface facilities and waste handling and emplacement equipment; legal and regulatory requirements
associated with drilling, operation, and post-closure; and access to transportation systems. Social and
political considerations include the distance from population centers and the support or opposition of local
and state entities and other stakeholders to the facility and its operations. These technical, logistical, and
sociopolitical factors are examined in the context of a consent-based siting process for a deep disposal
borehole, which would be the first phase in developing an operating facility.},

and other high-level waste in deep borehole repositories. The canister is suitable for disposal
of various waste forms, such as fuel assemblies and vitrified waste. The design addresses real
and perceived hazards of transporting and placing high-level waste, in the form of spent reactor
fuel, into a deep igneous rock environment. The thermal performance of the design is
emphasized.
To provide an option for second generation repositories at a competitive cost, the
canister reference design is based on standard oil drilling technology. Calculations are
conducted to assess stresses in the waste string and granite, temperatures and thermal gradients,
sensitivity of thermal calculations to variables, and cost. Recommendations are made for
future work.},

The Dresden Nuclear Power Station site consists of approximately 953 acres located in

north  and  the  Kankakee  River  to  the  east.    A  cooling  lake,  which  was  formed  by  
constructing an impervious earth-fill dike, encompasses a storage area of approximately 
1275 acres.  The lake is connected to the intake and discharge flumes of Units 2 and 3 
by  two  canals  (one  intake  and  one  discharge);  each  canal  is  about  11,000  feet  long.    
Dresden Units 2 and 3 are BWR/3’s designed and supplied by GE Nuclear Energy with 
251  inch  vessels.    The  primary  containment  of  each  unit  is  of  the  Mark  1  design  that  
consists of a drywell, a suppression chamber in the shape of a torus and a connecting 
vent system between the drywell and the suppression chamber.  Each unit is authorized 
to operate at a steady state reactor power level not to exceed 2957 megawatts thermal.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy recently filed a motion to withdraw the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission license application for the High Level Waste Repository at
Yucca Mountain in Nevada. As the U.S. has focused exclusively on geologic disposal in
shallow mined repositories for the past two decades, an examination of disposal
alternatives will be necessary should the Yucca Mountain Project be terminated. This
provides an opportunity to study other promising waste disposal technologies. One such
technology is the use of very deep boreholes in monolithic granite to permanently
segregate high level wastes from the biosphere. While research in this field has focused
on vertical emplacement techniques, horizontal emplacement offers the significant
advantages of allowing increased emplacement lengths without crushing of the waste
package and the use of a single vertical shaft for drilling multiple horizontal shafts. This
project examines the application of currently deployed oil and natural gas directional
drilling techniques to borehole design. A large trade-space of potential borehole
configurations is evaluated and a final design selected using the "V-DeepBoRe" code, a
Monte-Carlo simulation based cost model for borehole construction and waste package
emplacement. Waste repackaging and reconstitution is evaluated to permit deployment
of waste in borehole diameters too small for intact fuel assemblies. A 5 m x 195.26 mm
(OD) cylindrical waste package is designed using P-110 drill string steel to meet strength
and thermal loading requirements; fuel centerline temperatures are shown to not exceed
190'C by analytical and finite element methods. The total cost of a national borehole
repository (including drilling, consolidating and encapsulating the fuel, emplacement, and
closure) is shown to fall below \$63/kgHM, well within the capacity of the DOE
Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Waste Fund.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power is producing electricity for the benefit of society but is also leaving radioactive residues behind. It is our responsibility to handle these residues in a safe and proper manner. The development of a system for handling spent fuel from nuclear power plants has proceeded in steps. The same is true for the actual construction of facilities and will continue to be the case for the final repository for spent fuel and other types of long-lived wastes. The primary objective in constructing the repository will be to isolate and contain the radioactive waste. In case the isolation fails for some reason the multibarrier system should retain and retard the radionuclides that might come into contact with the groundwater. A repository is now planned to be built in two steps where the first step will include deposition of about 400 canisters with spent fuel. This first step should be finished in about 20 years from now and be followed by an extensive evaluation of the results from not only this particular step but also from the development of alternative routes before deciding on how to proceed. A special facility to encapsulate the spent fuel is also required. Such an encapsulation plant is proposed to be constructed as an extension of the existing interim storage CLAB. Finding a site for the repository is a critical issue in the implementation of any repository. The siting process started a few years ago and made some progress but is by no means yet completed. It will go on at least into the early part of the next decade. When the present nuclear power plants begin to be due for retirement there should also be some facilities in place to take permanent care of the long-lived radioactive residues. Progress in siting will be a prerequisite for success in our responsibility to make progress towards a safe permanent solution of the waste issue.},

	abstract = {Dear Mr. Bae,
 
Attached, please find a zipped file containing the Form GC-859 Nuclear Fuel Data file.  All data are as of June 30, 2013 and represent data collected by EIA on the Form GC-859 survey.  These are the most recent data available.  The data file is in Microsoft Access format and has the file name of “GC859\_Distribution.accdb.”  Data that were designated by respondents as “proprietary” are not included.
The zipped file also contains a copy of the Form GC-859 Nuclear Fuel Data Survey with supplemental tables and instructions (file: Form GC859 Survey.doc) and a description of the Form GC-859 Nuclear Fuel Data file (file: DataFileDescriptionGC859\_DistCopy.doc).
Note that respondents were not required to report assemblies that had been shipped to away-from-reactor (off-site) facilities.  Previous surveys (RW-859) reflected all commercial spent nuclear fuel discharges, including assemblies that had been shipped to federal facilities.  Therefore, data previously reported may not be included in the attached file.
In order to view the database, the Microsoft Access format requires users’ computers to be registered for the component OfficeViewer.ocx.  Because the database is only tables, users will most likely see the error message “Your Microsoft Access database or project contains a missing or broken reference to the file ‘officeviewer.ocx’ version 8.0.”  Users must click “OK” several times before the error message disappears.  No data are harmed during this process and the database may be used fully after this process is complete.
The specific data you requested (names of each power plant and their spent fuel inventory) are in Tables AppendixC and C1.
Should you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Marta.Gospodarczyk@eia.gov (202-586-0527) or Nick Domenico at Nicholas.Domenico@eia.gov (202-586-4405).
Please confirm a receipt of this email and attached file.

Although it is the country with the largest number of commercial nuclear electric power plants, as of this writing the United States had no program in progress to dispose of the nuclear fuel discharges it had already accumulated. The impediments to progress in this area are primarily political rather than technical. The Nordic Countries Sweden and Finland have both decided on sites for excavated repositories in granite. The U.S. Department of Energy has submitted a site license application for a repository excavated in volcanic tuff. An analysis from Sandia National Laboratory has suggests that a deep borehole repository is feasible that would exceed U.S. regulatory standards on migration of radioactive materials into groundwater by over a billion fold. As of early 2015, the U.S. Administration, the U.S. Congress, and the State of Nevada were nevertheless at an impasse on how to dispose of only part of the fuel that had already been discharged from commercial nuclear reactors.},

	abstract = {Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently. As a result, many are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write more reliable and maintainable code with less effort. We describe a set of best practices for scientific software development that have solid foundations in research and experience, and that improve scientists' productivity and the reliability of their software.},
